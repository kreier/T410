## Hardware

We have a Raspberry Pi 1B from June 2012 with only the 26 pin on the GPIO header. On it a 480x320 3.5" display is mounted that needs a special driver. More on that in the Software section. It has only 2 USB2.0 ports. One for mouse/keyboard combo, the second for the TP-Link 8188eu WiFi dongle.

## Software

For the display you need this driver:

## History

### Reactivated software - 2020/11/17

Download Raspbian OS from scratch. The regular graphical screen would not start, performed some tests on the browser. For example, the octane benchmark performed only 155 points.

### Initial idea

T410
2020/03/03

Initiated in March 2020, this robot car is powered by a Raspberry Pi 1B with 3.5 inch 480x320 display for 80x25 characters at the terminal. It needs 40 seconds to boot. Reactivated in November 2020.
